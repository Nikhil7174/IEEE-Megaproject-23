## Team Details
- **Team Name:** Team Mavericks
- **Team Members:**
  - Kanishka Kumar Singh
  - Nayan Shenoy
  - Alexander Daniel

## Domain of Your Project
Web Development, Artificial Intelligence and Medical Aid.

## Idea
Our project revolves around a Django-based framework to create a website, to address one of the most common issues, in medical aid - instant diagnosis in time of need. We make created a website that takes in basic information from the patient and give a detailed analysis using our AI designed Chatbot - NutriBot, as well as a well graphed chart of Continuous Heartrate Monitoring. Our goal is to maximize help, with least effort.

## Tech Stack Used
- **Language:** `Python` `C++`
- **Back-end Tools:** `Plotly-Dash` `Django` `Open Ai` `Javascript`
- **Front-end Tools:** `HTML` `CSS` `FLASK` `Arduino C++`
- **Reference Tools:** `Bootstrap`

## Achievement So Far
Successfully implemented the idea after a few struggles with the Open Ai, we had to make some adjustments and last moment changes to make it turnout as good as possible. Finalizing the UI design was tricky but thanks to @Nayan and @KanishkaKrSingh we over came it.
## How to Execute Your Code

`Python 3.11>`

`softwares.txt`

- Clone the repo to your local directory
- Create a [venv] and install required libraries. {refer `softwares.txt`}
- Open the main folder, in VS Code or Command Prompt which contains manage.py file.
- Open that file in CMD and run the command --> `python manage.py runserver`

## Code Sample/Link to Hosted Website
We will be providing a link to how the software works in synchronized manner with Hardware.

This link leads to a video feed of the working of our Website and we put forward a plotted graph of heartrate reading monitoring for last few days, showing how the Arduino records the readings and sends them to plotly-dash via an python script which is then displayed on the website

 
### Code Sample

```bash
# pip install python 
pip install openai
pip install plotly
pip install pandas
pip install bootstrap
